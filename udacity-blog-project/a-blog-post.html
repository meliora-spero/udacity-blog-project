           <p>
             New research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research
             finds that elementary school teachers' unconscious biases
             significantly influence female students' academic choices later on.
             According to researchers Dr. Edith Sand, an economist at the Bank of
             Israel and an instructor at TAU's Berglas School of Economics, and Prof.
             Victor Lavy, a professor at Hebrew University and University of
             Warwick in England, the classroom teacher's unwitting prejudice is a
             key factor explaining the divergence of boys' and girls' academic
             preferences.
           </p>
           <p>
             "It isn't an issue of discrimination but of unconscious
             discouragement," said Dr. Sand.
           </p>
           <p>
             <blockquote>
               This discouragement, however, has implications. The track to computer
               science and engineering fields, which report some of the highest
               salaries, tapers off in elementary school.

           <h2>Taking the gender test</h2>
           <p>
             The research was carried out on three groups of students in Israel
             from sixth grade through the end of high school. The students were
             given two exams, the first graded by objective scorers who did not
             know their names and the second by instructors who did know them.
             In math, the girls outscored the boys in the test that was scored
             anonymously, but when graded by teachers who were familiar with their
             names, the boys outscored the girls. The effect was not the same for
             tests in non-math or science-related subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The researchers concluded that, in math and science, the teachers
            overestimated the boys' skills and underestimated the girls' abilities,
            and that this had long-term implications for students' attitudes
            toward these subjects.
          </p>
          <h2>Opting out</h2>
          <p>
            "When the same students reached junior high and high school, we
            examined their performances in matriculation exams ('Bagrut' in Hebrew),"
            said Dr. Sand. "The boys who had been encouraged when they were
            younger performed significantly better than their female counterparts,
            though the latter had objectively scored higher at a younger age."
          </p>
          <p>
            The researchers also monitored the advanced math and science courses
            that students chose to take in high school, concluding that the
            girls who had been discouraged by their elementary school teachers
            were much less likely than the boys to opt for advanced courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            "If teachers take into account these effects, it could lead to a
            reduction of the gender gap in achievement, especially in science
            and math," said Dr. Sand. "It is clear how important encouragement
            is for both boys and girls in all their subjects. Teachers play a
            critical role in lowering and raising the confidence levels of
            their students, which has serious implications for their futures."
