          Although higher education has already opened the door to equal
          opportunities for women and minorities in the US in the math and science
          professions, a new study suggests that elementary school teachers'
          unconscious biases significantly influence female students' academic
          choices later on.

          Born into poverty, dancer Josephine Baker became an overnight sensation
          in a vaudeville show, launching a glittering cabaret career that took her
          across the globe, from Broadway to Paris.<br><br>
          Yet Baker was no ordinary performer — she went on to become a Second World War
          spy, was active in the fight against segregation and even attracted the
          attentions of the FBI.

          As a teenager in Maryland in the 1950s, Mary Allen Wilkes had no plans
          to become a software pioneer — she dreamed of being a litigator.
          One day in junior high in 1950, though, her geography teacher surprised
          her with a comment: “Mary Allen, when you grow up, you should be a
          computer programmer!” Wilkes had no idea what a programmer was; she
          wasn’t even sure what a computer was. Relatively few Americans were.
          The first digital computers had been built barely a decade earlier at
          universities and in government labs.
