Udacity's first project for the Front End Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Submission

The project required to utilise HTML and CSS skills to build a personal blog website, including custom images, layout and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, students had to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting and style (i.e. all code is lowercase, it does not have trailing white spaces, indentation is consistent, etc.). Pages had to be made mobile-friendly and work correctly on all display sizes.
